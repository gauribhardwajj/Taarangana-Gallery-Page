# Overview of the project

The Taarangana website was designed for our university's annual fest to be `fully responsive`, ensuring compatibility with different screen sizes, including desktop and mobile. It was built with a focus on visual appeal and user experience. The gallery displays a series of images from the cultural fest, and the layout adapts fluidly across devices. The page efficiently loads all images, allowing users to scroll through them smoothly, making the gallery both accessible and engaging.

The gallery page is static, featuring an `infinite scroll` feature that works in both directions. The page also includes a heading with animated yellow dots and `two moving SVG images` of Pacman and a ghost that appear to chase each other along a dotted line. Additionally, I implemented a grain effect as the background, giving the page a textured look by fluctuating the opacity of an external image.
